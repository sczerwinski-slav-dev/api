## Laws of Code Thermodynamics

### Zeroeth Law

If a software project has a code complexity equal
to a “Hello, World!” project, it is effectively
a “Hello, World!” project.

### First Law

In order to produce any amount of code, an equivalent amount of coffee
must be supplied to the programmers.

### Second Law

The complexity of the code in any project can never be decreased over time,
without removing features from the project.

### Third Law

Code complexity of a project approaches a constant value,
at which the project becomes unmaintainable,
and must be reimplemented from scratch.
